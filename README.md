Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and Scikit-learn.
The model is trained and evaluated on an imbalanced dataset to accurately classify fraudulent and genuine transactions.

ðŸ“Š Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.

Data preprocessing & feature scaling.

Handling imbalanced dataset using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.

Training various ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualization.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
pip

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the notebook
You can explore the project by running the Jupyter notebooks:
jupyter notebook
Or execute the training script:
python src/train.py

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Model achieved X% recall on fraudulent transactions.
ROC-AUC: Y%
(Replace X and Y with your actual results.)

ðŸ“š Dataset
The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.
It contains anonymized features and is highly imbalanced.
